✨ Key Features
This tool automates the tedious process of on-page SEO analysis, providing a quick yet thorough overview of a webpage's health. It's designed for developers, content creators, and SEO specialists who need a rapid, data-driven assessment.

In-Depth Content Analysis: Calculates total word count and identifies the most frequently used keywords to gauge content focus.

Keyword Density Calculation: Determines the frequency of top keywords relative to the total word count.

Meta Tag Extraction: Pulls the page title and meta description to check for presence and length.

Header Tag (<h1>-<h6>) Analysis: Visualizes the distribution and structure of header tags, which is crucial for content hierarchy.

Image SEO Analysis: Counts all images and identifies how many are missing essential alt text.

Link Auditing: Differentiates between internal and external links to analyze the site's linking strategy.

Performance Score: Calculates a simple, aggregated SEO score based on multiple factors, presented in an easy-to-understand pie chart.

Graphical Reporting: Generates a clean, multi-plot visualization of all key metrics using Matplotlib for easy sharing and reporting.
